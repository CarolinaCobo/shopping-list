<h1> User Experience </h1>

## **User stories**

* As a user I want to log in using my Google Account.
* As a user I want to be able to add items to my list.
* As a user I want to delete individual items.
* As a user I want to delete all items at once.

## **Styling**

### Colours

Using [Colorhunt.co](https://colorhunt.co) I chose a simple palette with simple colours for an easy site navigation:

* ![#F3C409](https://via.placeholder.com/15/F3C409/000000?text=+) `#413B88` - Navbar and add items button.
* ![ecda92](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ecda92/000000?text=+) `#ecda92` - Hoover buttons.
* Tomato for Delete items and delete all.

### Fonts

* [Bebas Neue](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bebas+Neue?query=bebas+) - Site name
* [Quicksand](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand?query=quicksa) - All content on the page.

### Favicon

One of the emojis available on [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/emoji-favicons/)

## Database design

### **users collection**

| Field Description | Collection Key | Data type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unique ID | _id | ObjectId |
| User ID | user_id | String |
| First name | fname | String |

Objects inside the list array:

| Field Description | Collection Key | Data type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unique ID | _id | ObjectId
| List | value | String |
|||

Here a screenshot of the collection in the database:
